load_panel(.file_name = NULL, .panel_name = NULL, .panel_pattern = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.file_name}{Charcter vector giving the name of an external panel info
file. See below for the expected components.}

\item{.panel_name}{Charcter vector giving the name of the panel. See below
for accepted panel names.}

\item{.panel_pattern}{The pattern to look for. Can be a regular expression.}
}
\value{
A \code{list}
}
\description{
The panel information are stored in \code{resources} in the package directory
and cam be loaded by provi
}
\details{
If an explicit \code{.file_name} is given, \code{.panel_name} and
\code{.panel_pattern} are ignored. If no file is given but a
\code{.panel_name} is, the \code{.panel_pattern} i ignored. Only if no
\code{.file_name} and \code{.panel_name} are given, is the
\code{.panel_pattern} used.

\section{Included panels}{


\itemize{
\item Human Th Cytokine Panel (13-plex)
\item Human Cytokine Panel 2 (13-plex)
\item Human Proinflammatory Chemokine Panel (13-plex)
\item Human Growth Factor Panel (13-plex)
}
}

\section{Example panel file}{


The panel information files are formatted in YAML. It has three main parts:
\itemize{
\item Some general information about the panel - The order of the major bead
groups in the forward and side scatter - Analytes, where each bead ID is
listed for each major bead group. The bead IDs are further somplemented
with the name of the analyte and the start concentration of the standard
value
}

The 'Human Th Cytokine Panel (13-plex)' YAML file is found in
\code{/resources/legendplex_human_th_cytokine_panel_13-plex.yml} of the
package directory.
}
